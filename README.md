# LMF: a new test suite for evolutionary large-scale multiobjective optimization
Evolutionary large-scale multiobjective optimization (ELMO) has received increasing attention in recent years. 
This study has compared various existing optimizers for ELMO on different benchmarks, 
revealing that both benchmarks and algorithms for ELMO still need significant improvement. 
Thus, a new test suite and a new optimizer framework are proposed to further promote the research of ELMO. 
More realistic features are con-sidered in the new benchmarks, such as mixed formulation of objective functions, 
mixed linkages in variables, and imbalanced contributions of variables to the objectives, 
which are challeng-ing to the existing optimizers. To better tackle these benchmarks, 
a variable group-based learning strategy is embedded into the new optimizer framework for ELMO, 
which significantly im-proves the quality of reproduction in large-scale search space.
